Blinkit SDE Intern Challenge
We were asked to build a simple app to upload images with authentication, I went a step ahead and made it into a complete lost and found management system. IMPORTANT NOTE: I have voluntarily not removed the .env file for easy access to the project, as the database does not contain any sensitive information.

Instructions
Client Setup
Navigate to the client folder.
Run the following command to install all dependencies:
npm install
Start the client by running:
npm run start
This will open the browser automatically.
Server Setup
Minimize the browser.
Go to the server folder.
Install dependencies:
npm install
Start the server:
node server.js
Additional Information
The client folder contains the frontend application.
The server folder contains the backend server.
Ensure both the client and server are running simultaneously for the application to function properly.
